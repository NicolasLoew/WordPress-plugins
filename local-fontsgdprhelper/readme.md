WHAT DOES THIS PLUGIN DO?
After a german court ruled that embedding Google Fonts via Google API is violating GDPR (see e.g. https://wptavern.com/german-court-fines-website-owner-for-violating-the-gdpr-by-using-google-hosted-fonts), I created this plugin in order to better comply with GDPR. It simply wraps up the free fonts from FontAwesome (https://fontawesome.com/) and hosts them locally instead of retrieving them from the CDN. 
I will try to keep adding other (major) versions of the free Fontawesome icons as I go.

HOW TO USE:
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
Option 1:

1.) Download ZIP file of the plugin.

2.) Upload the Plugin to Wordpress, install & activate it.

3.) You should now be able to use Fontawesome free icons using the Syntax on your website.

Option 2:

1) Clone the repository and .zip the folder corresponding to the version of FontAwesome Fonts you want (e.g. v600-local stands for fontawesome version 6.0.0.).

2) Upload Plugin to WordPress.

3) Activate Plugin.

4) Use according to the FontAwesome syntax that applies to your version (e.g. for v 6.0.0: https://fontawesome.com/v6/docs).

FYI: This code can be easily adapted! This is why the plugin is called "Local Fonts GDPR Helper".
It helps you to basically self-host any styles or fonts you want to include on your WordPress site.
This compiled version of the plugin allows you to self-host the Fontawesome free icons on your WordPress website.

The code is very short and should be easy enough to understand and adapt. I have added comments on Github to help you with that.
If you have any questions, open a Github issue and I'll see what I can do to help you.
