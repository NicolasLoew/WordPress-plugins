After a german court ruled that embedding Google Fonts via Google API is violating GDPR  (see e.g. https://wptavern.com/german-court-fines-website-owner-for-violating-the-gdpr-by-using-google-hosted-fonts), I created this plugin in order to better comply with GDPR. It simply wraps up the free fonts from FontAwesome (https://fontawesome.com/) and hosts them locally instead of retrieving them from the CDN. I will try to keep adding other versions of FontAwesome fonts as I go. 

LICENSING: Please respect the licensing from FontAwesome that is attached in the various plugin folders. 

How to use: 
1) Download the folder (as .zip) corresponding to the version of FontAwesome Fonts you want (e.g. fa-v600-local stands for version 6.0.0.).
2) Upload Plugin to WordPress.
3) Activate Plugin
4) Use according to the FontAwesome syntax that applies to your version (e.g. for v 6.0.0: https://fontawesome.com/v6/docs).
